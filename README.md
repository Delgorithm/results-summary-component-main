## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Specially the use of media queries


### Continued development

I'd like to know how to put propreties in the right order. How a front-end developer would add those properties, what would be its html semantic, what would he do first...
